			Welcome to my site!
		</p>
		<p>
		 I am your typical twenty-eight year old guy who burnt out with the career path I was on. I graduated with a Marketing Mangagement degee and worked finance for serveral years before realizing it didn't make me happy. 

		</p>
		<p>
			I couldn't see myself building a career in finance so I decided to take some time and travel. After coming back from traveling, I started taking some basic programmming courses and really enjoyed the results I was seeing.

		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of programming, I enjoy skiing, hiking, cooking, and traveling.
