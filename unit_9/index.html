		<h4> About Me </h4>
		<h5>Welcome to my site!</h5>
				
		<p>
		 		I am your typical twenty-eight year old guy who burnt out with the career path I was on. I graduated with a Marketing Management degee and worked finance for several years before realizing it didn't make me happy. 
		</p>
				I couldn't see myself building a career in finance so I decided to take some time and travel. After coming back from traveling, I started taking some basic programmming courses and really enjoyed everything I was learning. 
		<p>
						Outside of programming my hobbies include:
		

							<li>
							Skiing
							</li>
							<li>
							Hiking
							</li>  
							<li>
							Cooking
							</li> 
							<li>
							Traveling
							</li>

					<a href="word/index.htm">Traveling Around Myanmar</h3>
				<p>
					Myanmar is a country full of mystery. The country formally known as Burma opened its doors to tourism within the last decade. With that being said, the tourism infrastructure is still in its beginning stages.
