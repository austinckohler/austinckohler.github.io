	<h4>Career Change to Coding</h4>

	<h6>9/27/19</h6>

	<div><p>I am at the beginning of a career change and am <strong>very excited</strong> to start this new chapter of my life. Below, I listed several reasons why I chose coding for a new career.</p>

	<ul>
		
		<li><span id=list-items-blog-1>Flexibility:</span>
		Working remotely was incredibly attractive</li>
		
		<li><span id=list-items-blog-1>Passion:</span>
			once I started playing with code, I fell in love with the <em>results and challenge.</em></li>

		<li><span id=list-items-blog-1>Pay:</span>
			Obvsiously, the salary is nice too.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Prior to this, I worked finance for several years and I am currently working for a software company as technical support rep.</p></div>
